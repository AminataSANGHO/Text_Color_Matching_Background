# Project Description: Color Matching Text Styler

The Color Matching Text Styler is an innovative web application that leverages deep learning technology to dynamically adjust the text color based on a user-selected background color. The system utilizes a trained deep learning model with a classification capability spanning 10 color classes. Users can choose a background color through a color picker, and the system's model predicts the appropriate text color that ensures optimal visibility and aesthetics.ðŸŒŸ
